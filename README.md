# Syntax Snorlax_Java Poké

Java Poké:

Java Poké is a Java-based console game that recreates the experience of engaging in the end-game challenge of Pokémon Yellow. In this game, players will battle against the Elite Four trainers to become the #1 Pokémon trainer.

Getting Started:

To run the game, you will need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed on your computer. Once you have these installed, you can extract the zip file and navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt. From there, you can run the game using the following command:

java -jar javapoke.jar

Gameplay:

At the start of the game, the user will create a Pokémon trainer or choose from the selected pool of trainers. From there, users will choose their Pokémon to battle the Elite Four. They will be given a collection of Pokémon to choose from. Once the user has selected their Pokémon to battle with, they will begin the challenge and start a Pokémon battle with the first Elite Four Trainer.

Both the trainer and player will engage in a turn-by-turn Pokémon battle until all of the enemy’s Pokémon are defeated or the player is defeated. If the player is defeated, the game is over. If the player beats the trainer, they will be prompted to continue or run away (Game Over) if the challenge is too hard. If they choose to continue, the next trainer will follow up and fight the player/user in a Pokémon battle. This will continue until all trainers in the Elite Four are defeated or the player/user no longer has an alive/active Pokémon to battle with.
